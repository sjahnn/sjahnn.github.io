I received my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) in the spring of 2023, where I was advised by [Somnath Datta](https://biostat.ufl.edu/profile/datta-somnath/) and [Samuel S. Wu](https://biostat.ufl.edu/profile/wu-samuel/). I was a NIH/NIAAA T32 Predoctoral Fellow at the Southern HIV and Alcohol Research Consortium, [Emerging Pathogens Institute](https://epi.ufl.edu/) (PI: [Robert L. Cook](https://epidemiology.phhp.ufl.edu/profile/cook-robert/)) from January 2021 to May 2023. 

Before that, I was a biostatistician at the Biostatistics Unit, [Feinstein Institute for Medical Research](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/) at Northwell Health. I split my time there and [Lenox Hill Hospital](https://lenoxhill.northwell.edu/) in the Upper East Side.
I conferred my M.S. in Biostatistics from [Columbia University](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/) and B.A. in Mathematics from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/). 

I am originally from Seoul, South Korea, but I have also lived in [Irvine](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Irvine,+CA/@33.6864124,-117.9381987,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x80dcdd0e689140e3:0xa77ab575604a9a39!8m2!3d33.6845673!4d-117.8265049!16zL20vMGQ3azF6?entry=ttu), [Boston](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Boston,+MA/@42.3138779,-71.2999263,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e3652d0d3d311b:0x787cbf240162e8a0!8m2!3d42.3600825!4d-71.0588801!16zL20vMDFjeF8?entry=ttu), New York (pre-Ph.D.), [Gainesville](https://www.google.com/maps?sca_esv=13b8ee85e24d7ba9&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1064US1064&output=search&q=gainesville+fl&source=lnms&entry=mc&ved=1t:200715&ictx=111), [Bloomington](https://www.google.com/maps?sca_esv=13b8ee85e24d7ba9&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1064US1064&output=search&q=bloomington+indiana&source=lnms&entry=mc&ved=1t:200715&ictx=111), and now back in [New York](https://www.google.com/maps?sca_esv=13b8ee85e24d7ba9&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1064US1064&q=new+york&biw=1920&bih=917&dpr=2&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ved=1t:200715&ictx=111).
