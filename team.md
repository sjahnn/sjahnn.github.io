**Weijia Fu, M.S.** (Biostatistician II, Dec. 2023 -- Now)

Weijia holds an MSc in Biostatistics from the University of Washington in Seattle. Prior to joining the Mount Sinai, she was a member of Dr. Michael Wu's lab at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where she focused on the research of statistical challenges in microbiome data and association testing for high-dimensional data. As a team member, Weijia has been involved in (1) the development of statistical methodologies and (2) the analyses of high-dimensional -omics data and large-scale population-level data. She has expertise in statistical computing in Python and R. Her recent accomplishments include an identification of cell-type-specific associations from bulk high-throughput omics data, a revealing of novel mechanisms for prostate cancer survival through a transcriptome-wide association study, and a construction of Docker for data simulators.
